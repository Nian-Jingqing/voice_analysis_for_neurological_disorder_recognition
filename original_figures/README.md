# Materials for "Voice Analysis for Neurological Disorder Recognition - a Systematic Review and Perspective on Emerging Trends"

Reproduce the materials for "Voice Analysis for Neurological Disorder Recognition - a Systematic Review and Perspective on Emerging Trends".

The figures are plotted in [plots.ipynb](plots.ipynb), information on the subject numbers is evaluated in [tables.ipynb](tables.ipynb).


## Setup

Create a virtual environment of your choice for Python 3.8.10 and activate it.  
When crating the plots, `python3 -m venv` and `pip` were used for package managing.  
In the activated environment, run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt.lock
```
to install the exact package versions as when creating these materials.

The resulting plots are saved in [figures/](figures/); on one hand as individual plots and on the other hand combined as subplots.
